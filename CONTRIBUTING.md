# Issues
Issues can be reported by anyone. Only report issues on Beta or Release builds. Any issues on Alpha or Pre-Release builds will be promptly deleated.

This is because during Alpha and Pre-Release, I am constantly changing things and what is an issue for you may be something fixed in the update I'm working on. They're simply too unstable.

To report an issue, please state the Build type and version. AKA: [Beta v0.9.1] Planets explode when clicked.

In the main body, explain the issue and how to replicate, if possible. Give as much info as possible and any error messages. I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

You may see Alpha issues reported. These are ones I have done for record keeping. ONLY if you're working on the project with me, you may add Alpha issues.

# Small Fix
If you found an issue or a feature you want and managed to program it yourself, great! Submit a pull request, the version you based it off of and describe it. I'll look it over and give it the green light.

Be aware I may be working on that feature at that time, so you may instead want to 'join the project' or just contact me about what you plan to do at joseph_keane@live.co.uk.

# Joining the Project
If you want to actively help, that's great! I've not got much experience programming with others, but I'm sure we can figure it out. Contact me, explain what you can do to help the project and we can do it!

If you happen to be an artist, that would also be great as I've not got particuarly good art skills. E-Mail me and I'll give you a list of stuff to do. The list should grow with the project.

# Ideas
You can't program, and don't know art, but have this perfect idea of what you can do with the game. E-Mail me with the idea and I'll see what I can do with it. Be aware not all (or even necessarily any) ideas will be implemented.
