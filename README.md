# Planet-Clicker
A game involving clicking a planet.

The game should extend in the future to have multiple planets, upgrades, resources and actually be properly sized for every device.

If you're interested in helping, contact me at joseph_keane@live.co.uk. I could do with any artwork or even programming skills (be aware though I am not particularly experienced yet)
Ideas are also welcome, but whether it is added is ultimately up to me.

Hopefully it should be on the play store and desktop assuming it get's to that point.
The game uses the LibGDX engine [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
